### Project Description

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict air quality, contributing to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by providing actionable insights for improving environmental health. The dataset, which includes various air pollutants such as CO, NO2, and NOx, underwent extensive preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers. Key pollutants were selected based on their correlations to ensure accurate predictions. Two primary models were implemented: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest Classifier, each trained and evaluated to determine the air quality index (AQI). Visualization techniques such as 3D scatter plots were employed to illustrate the model performance and the effectiveness of the dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning models in predicting air quality, achieving notable accuracy in classifying air quality levels. The KNN model provided a straightforward approach to classification, while the Random Forest model offered robustness through ensemble learning. Both models highlighted the importance of selecting relevant features and handling data anomalies effectively. The visualizations underscored the models' predictive capabilities, with PCA helping to elucidate the data's structure. Overall, this project not only reinforces the potential of machine learning in environmental monitoring but also paves the way for further enhancements to achieve more sustainable development outcomes.
